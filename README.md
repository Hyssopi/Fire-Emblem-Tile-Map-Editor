Allows user to create, load, and modify Fire Emblem GBA maps.

## Details


Emulator
- Switch to show only Background 3 in the emulator, this is the background layer that has the map image
- Take screen captures of Background 3, keeping in mind that some tiles are animated and therefore has to be timed right (pause the game) when taking a screen capture
- Some backgrounds have some overlay over it and cannot have a screen capture taken, for example: Fire Emblem 6 Chapter 08x. Has blinking red on Background 3 to simulate the fire
- Some levels are fog of war which is still shown in Background 3. Therefore recommended to use Thief units with Torch item with Cheats (unit turn is always available to move)
- Some levels have parallax backgrounds. For example Fire Emblem 6 Chapter 16x, Fire Emblem 6 Chapter 24, and Fire Emblem 6 Final Chapter


GIMP
- Stitch map screen captures together
- Double check that animated tiles are properly stitched

References 24-bit
- Output stitched maps to 24-bit folder, Screen captures from mGBA are in 24-bit color depth
