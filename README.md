Allows user to create, load, and modify Fire Emblem GBA maps.

## Details


#### Emulator
- Switch to only show `Background 3` in the emulator. This is the background layer that has the map image.
- Take screen captures of Background 3, keeping in mind that some tiles are animated and therefore has to be timed right (pause the game) when taking a screen capture.
- Some backgrounds have some overlay over it and cannot have a screen capture taken. For example: Fire Emblem 6 Chapter 08x. Has blinking red on Background 3 to simulate the fire effects.
- Some levels are fog of war which is still shown on the tiles of the maps in Background 3 layer. Therefore recommended to use Thief units with Torch item with Cheats (unit turn is always available to move).
- Some levels have parallax backgrounds. For example: Fire Emblem 6 Chapter 16x, Fire Emblem 6 Chapter 24, and Fire Emblem 6 Final Chapter.

#### GIMP
- Stitch screen captures together to form the complete map.
- Double check that maps with animated tiles are properly stitched.

#### References/Images (24-Bit Color Depth)
- Emulators such as mGBA use 24-bit color depth instead of the original GBA 15-bit color depth.
- Place completed stitched maps to the `Images (24-Bit Color Depth)` folder.
